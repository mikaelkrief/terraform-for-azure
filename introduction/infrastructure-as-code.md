# Infrastructure As Code

Among DevOps practices, we often find the **Infrastructure As Code** \(IaC\) principle, which consists in coding the infrastructure provisioning and configuration steps instead of performing them manually.

* Infrastructure As Code helps to automate the infrastructure deployment process in a repeatable and consistent manner, which has the following advantages:
* Deployments are faster and more efficient from the development environment to production. 
* IaC completely standardizes the infrastructure configuration to reduce the risk of errors or deviations. 
* IaC allows your company to use continuous integration and continuous deployment techniques while minimizing the introduction of human errors after the development phase. 
* This code can be versioned and controlled in a source code manager such as Git.
